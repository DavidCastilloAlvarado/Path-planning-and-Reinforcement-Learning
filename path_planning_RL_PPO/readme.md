# Reinforcement Learning
![alt text](https://github.com/DavidCastilloAlvarado/path_planning_self_driving/raw/master/path_planning_RL_PPO/images/RL.png)
Reinforcement learning is considered as one of three machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning. It differs from supervised learning in that correct input/output pairs[clarification needed] need not be presented, and sub-optimal actions need not be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on performance[clarification needed], which involves finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).


# Proximal Policy Optimization



# Neural Network for both of them, Actor and Critic
They was built usign tensorflow-gpu 1.6, in python3.5
